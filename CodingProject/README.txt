2. Activity 5 is in main/MyMethods.java. 

3. 
    For my project I created a method to hide music in an image and a method to reveal the secret music which plays the notes. hideText( ExampleImage, "text") and revealMusic(ExampleImage)

    MyMethods.java can be run in VScode. There is already an example to run so no need to add any code. Other examples can be uncommented to play different songs.
